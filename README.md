## **What we have done:**

**The implementation of the constructor and destructor for the three matrix classes**

**The copy constructor and copy assignment operator for the three matrix classes**

**The genericity for the three matrix classes and inheritance relationship**

**The operations of reshaping and slicing**

**The transformation between our library's matrices and OpenCV matrices**

**The computation of the maximum value, the minimum value, the average value, and the sum of all items**

**The reduction operations supporting axis-specific**

**The trace and determinant of a matrix**

**The transpose matrix, inverse matrix, and conjugate matrix of a certain matrix**

**The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix**

**The QR factorization of a matrix**

**The Gaussian elimination of a matrix**

**The basic addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, and scalar division among matrices**

**The dot-product, cross-product, and convolution among matrices**

**The exception handling when doing the operations of matrices**
